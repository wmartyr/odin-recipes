  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    French toast is a dish made of sliced bread soaked in beaten eggs and typically milk, then pan fried. Alternative
    names and variants include "eggy bread", "Bombay toast", "gypsy toast", and "poor knights".
  </p>
  <p>
    When French toast is served as a sweet dish, milk, sugar, vanilla or cinnamon are also commonly added before
    pan-frying, and then it may be topped with sugar (often powdered sugar), butter, fruit, or syrup. When it is a
    savory dish, it is generally fried with a pinch of salt or pepper, and it can then be served with a sauce such as
    ketchup or mayonnaise.
