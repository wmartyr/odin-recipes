  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    A pancake (or hot-cake, griddlecake, or flapjack) is a flat cake, often thin and round, prepared from a starch-based
    batter that may contain eggs, milk and butter and cooked on a hot surface such as a griddle or frying pan, often
    frying with oil or butter. It is a type of batter bread. Archaeological evidence suggests that pancakes were
    probably eaten in prehistoric societies.

    The pancake's shape and structure varies worldwide. In the United Kingdom, pancakes are often unleavened and
    resemble a crêpe. In North America, a leavening agent is used (typically baking powder) creating a thick fluffy
    pancake. A crêpe is a thin Breton pancake of French origin cooked on one or both sides in a special pan or crepe
    maker to achieve a lacelike network of fine bubbles. A well-known variation originating from southeast Europe is a
    palačinke, a thin moist pancake fried on both sides and filled with jam, cream cheese, chocolate, or ground walnuts,
    but many other fillings—sweet or savoury—can also be used.
